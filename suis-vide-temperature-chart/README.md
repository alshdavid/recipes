# Definitions

## A Log reduction 

A Log reduction is a 90% reduction of a pathogen. 

For example, a 2-log reduction is a 99% reduction of a pathogen and a 3-log reduction is a 99.9% reduction of a pathogen in a product.

## Pasteurization

FSIS defines pasteurization as any process, treatment, or combination thereof, that eliminates or reduces the number of pathogenic microorganisms to achieve at least a 5-log reduction of Salmonella on or in meat or poultry products in the final finished package. 

In cases where the products are known to be positive for Lm, because they test positive or cross over a surface that is positive for Lm, the process would need to achieve a 5-log reduction of Lm on or in meat or poultry products in the final package to make them safe for human consumption. 

This process should be effective for a period that is at least as long as the shelf life of the food (as determined by the manufacturer) when it is stored under normal and moderate abuse conditions. With adequate validation, pasteurization processes may include alternative technologies other than traditional cooking (e.g., high pressure processing (HPP)). FSIS will not, however, consider irradiation a pasteurization process or treatment. 

Although the effect is similar to pasteurization, FSIS considers ionizing radiation a food additive under 9 CFR 424.22. FSIS considers products with a raw appearance that have been treated with a lethality process that renders the product RTE, and that are not post-lethality exposed (e.g., “steak tartare” subjected to a HPP treatment) as pasteurized. For the product to be “pasteurized,” the HPP treatment needs to be sufficient to eliminate the number of pathogenic microorganisms to make the product safe for human consumption (so there are no detectable pathogens) and be effective for at least as long as the product shelf life. 

Establishments may label products as “pasteurized.” However, the term “pasteurized” is a special statement and claim that needs to be submitted to the Agency for label approval under 9 CFR 412.1(c)(3). The request for label approval needs to include supporting documentation providing evidence that the process achieves a 5-log reduction of Salmonella or Lm.
